        <p>
        I am Muhammad Abdulloh Komilov, a 23-year-old Software Engineer from Andijan, Uzbekistan, currently living in Uzbekistan, Tashkent.
        I am always contributing to developer events by giving a talk or as a mentor. As a developer, I really want to see more diversity in the industry.

        <p>Recently I experimented working standing and found it really useful to stay focused and a little healthier. I was able to transform my workstation with the books I read.
        I am also known as "clever coder", very handy nature for programmers. I love repetitive tasks, I see them as an opportunity for automation.</p>
